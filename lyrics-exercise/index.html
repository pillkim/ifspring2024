        <p class="direction">[Verse 1]</p>
        <p>Album on hold, whole word on hold</p>
        <p>The crowd is like "ho!", operator's like "hold"</p>
        <p>(Please hold)</p>
        <p>Man, now ain't that cold?</p>
        <p>I'm just trying to talk to my homie, that's up in the hole</p>
        <p>Homegirl ain't trying to be a ho, even though she on a pole</p>
        <p>Can she get a second chance? No!</p>
        <p>Whoa! Like the opposite of gold</p>
        <p>That ain't how it's supposed to be, a butterfly</p>
        <p>For the sake of rhyming let's just say "butterflyee"</p>
        <p>The truth stings like Muhammad Ali</p>
        <p>I tell 'em tell 'em don't homicide me</p>
        <p>I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes</p>
        <p>Fighting for his fans and, fighting for his folks</p>
        <p>But the boo's from the crowd they become so loud</p>
        <p>If I could block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and</p>
        <p>Dance around the ring, but until then I'll sing</p>
        <p class="direction">[Hook]</p>
        <p>I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me</p>
        <p>It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be</p>
        <p>Until I get there</p>
        <p>Until I get there</p>
        <p>Yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect</p>
        <p>But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it</p>
        <p>When I get there</p>
        <p>When I get there</p>
        <p class="direction">[Verse 2]</p>
        <p>"Doctor doctor please! The fame ain't painless enough"</p>
        <p>That's cause you ain't famous enough</p>
        <p>You got a little game, but your name ain't ringing enough</p>
        <p>He said "take two of these and put change in my cup"</p>
        <p>I said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more</p>
        <p>Prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door</p>
        <p>"Out!" Ouch, I'm telling you this all from a therapist's couch</p>
        <p>"Tell me about your mother? What she's all about?"</p>
        <p>Prescribed me an interview and then told me to bounce</p>
        <p>Damn, geez, the world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis</p>
        <p>Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees</p>
        <p>Went unconscious, they rushed me to a concert</p>
        <p>Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup</p>
        <p>They fed me magazine covers and video shoots</p>
        <p class="direction">[Hook]</p>
        <p>I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me</p>
        <p>It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be</p>
        <p>Until I get there</p>
        <p>Until I get there</p>
        <p>Yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect</p>
        <p>But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it</p>
        <p>When I get there</p>
        <p>When I get there</p>
        <p class="direction">[Verse 3]</p>
        <p>And when I finally make it, I'mma stunt so hard</p>
        <p>Evil as Knievel, I'mma jump so far</p>
        <p>Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't coming back</p>
        <p>Be a jerk to them jerks, yeah that'll make 'em hurt</p>
        <p>Huh? said a young boy in the mirror</p>
        <p>A young version of me, so I started to tear up</p>
        <p>He said "you need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up</p>
        <p>You're already here, just be yourself from here up"</p>
        <p>Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar</p>
        <p>Something I was taught, something I had lost</p>
        <p>If you are afraid of the fear that you gon' change some</p>
        <p>All you gotta do is just remember where you came from</p>
        <p class="direction">[Hook]</p>
        <p>I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me</p>
        <p>It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be</p>
        <p>Until I get there</p>
        <p>Until I get there</p>
        <p>Yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect</p>
        <p>But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it</p>
        <p>When I get there</p>
        <p>When I get there</p>
