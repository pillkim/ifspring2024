    <h1>My Hello World Page</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>My name is Phillip! I'm a senior studying computer science and communication design</li>
        <li>I'm interested in web design and frontend web development, so I thought this class would help me in those
            skills.</li>
        <li>I have experience with HTML/CSS/JS from 330, and my job over the summer.</li>
        <li>I hope to improve my HTML/CSS and skills! I want to be better at specifically want to get better at styling
            elements with CSS!</li>
        <li>I expect designing for the screen to be different than desiging for paper in the way since there can be a
            lot of overlapping and interactive elements.</li>
        <li><a href="http://huskyfox.com">Huskyfox Studio</a> is a branding studio. Their site is clean, not laggy, and
            is able to display a lot of different project examples. To me, it is a site that works well because it is
            able to show many projects without seeming repetitive and boring.</li>
        <li><a href="https://ordinarypeople.info/work">Ordinary People</a> This page is a display page for all of
            Ordinary People's work. I like this page because it has so much information. The page communicates well
            because it is able to give a visual insight into each projct without clouding the page up with text. After
            all, this is a visual branding studio.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a> The apple site sometimes is too much for me visually, but as a
            company that is supposed to represent luxury and technology, I feel that it is successful. In the product
            pages, there are often cool scrolling animations, which can be laggy, but it creates a memorable impact and
            conveys that their products are luxury and futuristic.</li>
