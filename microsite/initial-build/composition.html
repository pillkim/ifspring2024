        <h1>Composition</h1>
        <p>The Big Mac is made with two 1.6 oz (45 g) beef patties, a "special sauce" (similar to Thousand Island
            dressing),[9] shredded iceberg lettuce, one processed American cheese slice, two slices of dill pickle, and
            minced onions, served on a three slice sesame seed bun.[10] On October 1, 2018, McDonald's announced that it
            would remove all artificial preservatives, flavors, and coloring from the Big Mac.[11][12]</p>
        <p>Big Mac Sauce is delivered to McDonald's restaurants in sealed canisters designed by Sealright, from which it
            is meant to be directly dispensed using a calibrated "sauce gun" that dispenses a specified amount of the
            sauce for each pull of the trigger.[14]
            In 2012, McDonald's executive chef Dan Coudreaut released a YouTube video revealing the recipe of the sauce.
            It consists of store-bought mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish and yellow mustard whisked together with
            vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.[15][16]
            In 2018, McDonald's revamped the sauce by removing potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, and calcium disodium
            EDTA.[11][12]

            The sauce is occasionally available for purchase on its own for a limited time. The first time was in 2015.
            A 25 ml (0.85 U.S. fl oz) tube was available for purchase but only in restaurants in Australia.[17] It was
            available was in 2020. A 50 ml (1.7 U.S. fl oz) pot was available for purchase but only in restaurants in
            the UK and Ireland.[18] In 2023 and early 2024 it was available in Hungary.[19]

            The Big Mac, along with many other McDonald's products, was first served in a collapsible cardboard
            container that was changed to a "clamshell" style, polystyrene foam container in the late 1970s. Polystyrene
            foam containers were phased out beginning in 1990, due to environmental concerns.</p>
