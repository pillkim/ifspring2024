                <h2>The Big Mac started from humble beginnings, debuting on April 22, 1967 as just an idea to make a
                    more
                    satisfying burger.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="bodyContent">
                <p>The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, who operated
                    several McDonald's restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. It was created in the kitchen of Delligatti's
                    first
                    McDonald's franchise, located on McKnight Road in suburban Ross Township.
                    The Big Mac debuted at the McDonald's owned by Delligatti in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, on April 22,
                    1967,
                    selling for US$0.45 (equivalent to $4.11 in 2023).
                    It was designed to compete with Big Boy Restaurants' Big Boy hamburger. Eat'n Park was the
                    Pittsburgh
                    area's
                    Big Boy franchisee at the time. The Big Mac proved popular and it was added to the menu of all U.S.
                    McDonald's restaurants in 1968.</p>
                <p>War veteran Delligatti was no stranger to the fast-food industry – he'd worked in several drive-in
                    joints
                    in California following the Second World War
                    –and he ultimately went on to open just shy of 50 McDonald's stores across the state of
                    Pennsylvania.

                        <h3>Jim Delligatti and his famous Big Mac</h3>
                        <p class="photoGrid_text">After a decade of being in business, master franchisee Delligatti came
                            up
                            with a smart plan to
                            keep punters pouring in. His key customers were male workers from the nearby steel mills
                            and,
                            after a hard shift, they reportedly weren't satisfied by the smaller burgers Delligatti had
                            to
                            offer (the classic cheeseburger pictured, for example). Taking inspiration from the whopping
                            sandwiches sold at diners nearby, Delligatti developed the idea for a teetering
                            "double-decker"
                            burger.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Though it's hard to believe given the Big Mac's status today, the mighty burger wasn't a hit with
                    McDonald's
                    bosses at first. They were reluctant to stray from their tried-and-tested – and immensely popular –
                    hamburgers, and at first prevented Delligatti from rolling the creation out in his store. But
                    Delligatti
                    wasn't going down without a fight, and his persistence ultimately led to a change of heart.
                    McDonald's
                    top
                    dogs had given
                    Delligatti the green light by 1967.</p>
                <p>There was one condition: Delligatti could whip up his whopping hamburger, but only if he made it with
                    ingredients and products that were already part of the McDonald's portfolio. Ever the maverick,
                    though,
                    Delligatti eschewed
                    the restaurant's existing bread in favour of a double-sliced, sesame-seed-topped bun sourced from a
                    local
                    bakery. </p>
                <p>Delligatti spent a few weeks fine-tuning his recipe – including developing the burger's tangy,
                    creamy,
                    signature 'special sauce' – and was ready with his titanic creation by 1967. He began selling the
                    burger
                    –
                    made up of two beef patties, the 'special sauce', cheese, pickles, onions and lettuce, cased
                    together in
                    the
                    sesame-seed bun – at his Uniontown store that same year. It went for 45 cents a time.</p>
                <p>
                    The Big Mac wasn't always the 'Big Mac' though. The burger began its life under several decidedly
                    less
                    catchy names, including the Blue Ribbon Burger and The Aristocrat. Young advertising secretary
                    Esther
                    Rose, a 21-year-old advertising
                    secretary
                    who worked at McDonald's corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Il,
                    is widely credited as the brains behind the burger's eventual and enduring name: the Big Mac.
                </p>
                <p>The beastly burger was a roaring success, and Delligatti’s franchise thrived. And, in a complete 180,
                    McDonald's bosses decided to roll out the Big Mac at stores across the country. In 1968, just one
                    year
                    after
                    Delligatti
                    began selling the burger at his own stores, the Big Mac was made available all over the States. </p>
                <p>With the Big Mac enjoying something of a cult status in America, it wasn't long before it found its
                    way
                    across the pond too. It not only graced international menus, but also found its way onto advertising
                    posters, being
                    proudly described as "a meal disguised as a sandwich". The "hot and hearty" Big Mac became a
                    favourite
                    the
                    world over. </p>
                <p>While today's Big Mac is almost identical to what it was in the 1960s, the burger's famous special
                    sauce
                    has
                    had
                    some tinkering over the years. It's often dubbed a closely guarded secret, but the basic recipe of
                    the
                    sauce
                    – which includes mayonnaise, sweet-pickle relish and yellow mustard – has actually been shared by
                    McDonald's
                    chefs online over the years. Originally two versions of the sauce existed, but the recipe was
                    finessed
                    into
                    a
                    single, mouthwatering recipe in 1972. It was altered once more in 1991, but had returned to its
                    original
                    glory by
                    2004.
